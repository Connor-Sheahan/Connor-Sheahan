- 👋 Hi, I’m @Connor-Sheahan.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Robotics, and Engineering. I'm currently looking to combine these three passions into some sort of mechatronics work.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Track One Undeclared Engineering at University of Toronto.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment (school is hard lol).
- 📫 How to reach me: Quickest way is to shoot me an email (connorsheahan2@gmail.com)!
- !! A lot of my files were uploaded via Git LFS due to large file size; this may make the "Download ZIP" button not work (downloads the 1kb pointer files). Sorry for the inconvinience!
