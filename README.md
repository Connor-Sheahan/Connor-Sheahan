- 👋 Hi, I’m @Connor-Sheahan
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Robotics, and Engineering. I'm currently looking to combine the three into some sort of mechatronics work.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Track One Undeclared Engineering at University of Toronto.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment (school is hard lol).
- 📫 How to reach me: Quickest way is to shoot me an email (connorsheahan2@gmail.com)!
