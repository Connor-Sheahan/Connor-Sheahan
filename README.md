- 👋 Hi, I’m @Connor-Sheahan.
- 👀 I’m a third year mechanical engineering student at The University of Toronto, and I'm taking two minors in Sustainable Energy and Mechatronics/Robotics.
- 💞️ I have many passions across the various engineering disciplines, but I'm particularly passionate about the designing of space systems and sustainable energy systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email at connorsheahan2@gmail.com!
- !! A lot of my files were uploaded via Git LFS due to large file size; this may make the "Download ZIP" button not work (downloads the 1kb pointer files). Sorry for the inconvinience!
